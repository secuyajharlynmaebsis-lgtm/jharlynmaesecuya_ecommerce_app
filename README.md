## Description
This project is a Flask-based REST API application created as part of **Activity 4 in IS 312**. The application demonstrates the use of Flask with a SQLite database to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for products and orders. It also shows how API requests are processed and how JSON responses are returned using a local development server.

## Framework Used
**Flask** – A lightweight Python web framework used for building web applications and REST APIs.

## How to Run the Application Locally
1. Open the project in **PyCharm**.
2. Make sure Flask and the required libraries are installed in the Python interpreter.
3. Run the `app.py` file.
4. The application will start a local development server at **http://127.0.0.1:5000**.
5. Use **Postman** to send requests and test the API endpoints.
